# AI Calc Professional Suite 💎🧠

AI Calc is a professional-grade, high-tech scientific computational suite built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It features a "Neural Master Solver" capable of providing step-by-step paths for complex mathematics and physics problems.

## 🚀 Live Application
**PWA Ready**: Installable on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS.
**Offline Support**: Works without internet once loaded.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Neural Master Solver (The Perfect Path)
- **Scientific Logic**: Uses `math.js` for advanced calculus, algebra, and trigonometry.
- **Step-by-Step Path**: Generates a logical "Perfect Path" for physics problems ($F=ma$, $v=d/t$, etc.).
- **Natural Language**: Understands human-like queries for unit conversions and calculations.

### 2. Multi-Functional Tools
- **Scientific Calculator**: Full trigonometry, square roots, and basic math.
- **Advanced Physics Lab**: Dedicated modules for Relativity (Lorentz Factor), Efficiency ($\eta$), and Dynamics.
- **Pro Unit Converter**: Conversion for Length, Weight, and Energy (including Solar Mass and Lightyears).

### 3. Premium Design System
- **Universal Display Support**: Fully responsive layout optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Ultra-Wide displays.
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Sleek backdrop blurs, neon accents, and dark mode support.
- **Animated Backgrounds**: Fixed glowing blobs for a futuristic feel.

### 4. Smart Records
- **Persistent History**: Saves all calculations and neural solutions to `LocalStorage`.
- **Side Records Rail**: Easy access to past work on desktop, collapsed for mobile productivity.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Structure**: Vanilla HTML5 / Semantic Layout
- **Logic**: JS (ES6+) / Math.js Engine
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / Vanilla CSS / Glassmorphism
- **App Support**: Service Workers / Manifest V3

## 📦 Installation
1. Open the application in any modern browser.
2. Click the **"Install"** button in the Records sidebar (or via browser menu).
3. The app will be added to your device's home screen or applications folder.
